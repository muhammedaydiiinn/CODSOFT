## Project 1: Movie Genre Prediction

This project aims to predict the genre of a movie based on its text summary.

The primary goal of this project is to utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and predict the genre(s) of a movie by processing its textual summary. By employing machine learning algorithms and NLP models, the project intends to classify movies into different genres based on the content of their textual summaries.
